"""Voice search: capture mic audio, transcribe with faster-whisper offline,
type the result into the focused window, press Enter after a configurable
silence threshold.

This module exposes two units:

- ``SilenceDetector``: pure-logic VAD state machine. Consumes a stream of
  ``is_speech`` booleans (one per audio frame) and reports the current phase.
  Tested in isolation.

- ``VoiceSearch``: orchestrator that owns the microphone, runs ``webrtcvad``
  against incoming frames, feeds them to ``SilenceDetector``, then transcribes
  the captured buffer with faster-whisper and types the result via pyautogui.
  Integration-only; not unit-tested.
