# HandVol

Gesture-controlled Windows volume + media using a webcam and MediaPipe.
Pinch your thumb and index in an OK sign to scrub volume, close your fist
to mute, open your palm to play/pause, and use sideways thumbs to skip
tracks.

| Gesture | Action |
|---|---|
| 👌 OK sign | Hold and move up/down to scrub volume |
| ✊ Closed fist | Toggle mute |
| ✋ Open palm | Toggle play/pause |
| ✌️ Victory | Focus Spotify (launch it if not running) |
| 🤟 ILoveYou | Close Spotify |
| 👉 Thumb sideways → right | Next track (works for either hand) |
| 👈 Thumb sideways → left | Previous track (works for either hand) |

Direction is reported in your real-world frame: thumb tip toward your
right = next, toward your left = previous, regardless of which hand.

No model training, no cloud calls, no per-app permissions. Runs locally
off the pretrained MediaPipe Gesture Recognizer, with custom
landmark-based detection layered on top for the OK sign and sideways
thumbs.

## Requirements

- Windows 10/11
- Python 3.11+
- A USB webcam (built for the NexiGo 1080p, works with anything DirectShow-compatible)

## Setup

Install dependencies directly into your system Python (no virtualenv):

```powershell
# from the repo root
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Download the MediaPipe gesture model bundle into `models/`:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/gesture_recognizer/gesture_recognizer/float16/1/gesture_recognizer.task
```

Save it as `models/gesture_recognizer.task`.

Also download the face landmarker model:

```
https://storage.googleapis.com/mediapipe-models/face_landmarker/face_landmarker/float16/1/face_landmarker.task
```

Save it as `models/face_landmarker.task`.

After first launch, run the face calibration once via the tray icon's
**Calibrate face...** menu item (or `python -m handvol.calibration`).
Gestures are blocked until calibration has been completed.

## Run

```powershell
python handvol.pyw
```

HandVol installs a **system-tray icon** (bottom-right, in the hidden-icon
overflow on a fresh Windows install — drag it onto the taskbar to pin).

- **Left-click the tray icon** → toggle the OpenCV preview window on/off.
- **Right-click** → menu with *Show preview* (checked when visible),
  *Pause* (releases the camera; useful before joining a virtual meeting),
  and *Quit*.
- **Esc** inside the preview window also hides it.
- To quit, use the tray's *Quit* item (or kill `pythonw.exe` from Task Manager).

By default it starts tray-only (no window). Pass `--show` to launch with
the preview already open.

### Useful flags

| Flag | What it does |
|---|---|
| `--sensitivity 80` | Volume points per full-frame vertical travel. Higher = faster scrub. |
| `--smoothing 0.3` | EMA factor on pinch position. Lower = laggier, higher = jitterier. |
| `--cam 0` | Webcam index, if you have more than one. |
| `--debug` | Print frame-by-frame state and scrub values. |
| `--no-audio` | Skip all pycaw/media calls — overlay only, for tuning. |
| `--show` | Start with the preview window already open (otherwise tray-only). |

## Launch silently at startup

1. Press `Win+R`, type `shell:startup`, Enter.
2. Right-click → New → Shortcut → browse to `handvol_startup.vbs` in this repo.
3. Next login, HandVol runs hidden. Quit anytime via the tray icon.

The `.vbs` shim invokes `pythonw.exe` so no console window flashes.

### Gesture detection internals

MediaPipe's built-in classifier handles `Closed_Fist`, `Open_Palm`,
`Victory`, and `ILoveYou` directly. The OK sign and the four sideways
thumb labels (`left_hand_thumb_left`, `left_hand_thumb_right`,
`right_hand_thumb_left`, `right_hand_thumb_right`) are detected from the
21 hand landmarks in `capture.py`:

- **OK sign:** thumb tip touches index tip; middle, ring, pinky extended.
- **Sideways thumb:** thumb extended horizontally with the other four
  fingers curled into a fist. Direction comes from the thumb-tip x
  relative to the thumb base; hand identity comes from MediaPipe's
  handedness (with the convention inverted because the frame is
  pre-mirrored for selfie view).

Tuning constants for the landmark checks live at the top of
`handvol/capture.py`.

## Testing

```powershell
python -m pytest tests/ -q
```

The scrubber and state machine are pure logic and tested without a
webcam.

## Troubleshooting

- **`Could not open camera index 0`** — another app has the camera, or
  Windows Camera privacy settings are blocking desktop apps. Try
  `--cam 1`.
- **`AudioDevice has no attribute Activate`** — pycaw version mismatch.
  The code handles both old and new pycaw via `_dev` fallback; make
  sure you're on the version pinned in `requirements.txt`.
- **Media key does nothing** — the `keyboard` library needs admin on
  some Windows configs. Run from an elevated terminal, or `pyautogui`
  will be tried as fallback if installed.
- **Tray icon missing** — Windows hides new tray icons in the overflow
  by default. Click the `^` chevron in the taskbar and drag the HandVol
  icon onto the visible area to pin it.
- **Side-thumb skip/prev firing the wrong direction** — extremely
  unlikely, but if MediaPipe's handedness convention differs on your
  build, swap the `hand_prefix` mapping in
  `handvol/capture.py::_detect_side_thumb`.
